Project Overview 

This project focused on analyzing Airbnb listing data to understand the key factors influencing room pricing and to build predictive models that support data-driven pricing decisions for new and existing hosts. The objective was to identify critical pricing determinants, improve price estimation accuracy, and translate analytical insights into actionable recommendations that could enhance host profitability and market competitiveness.

Data Collection & Preparation

I worked with a structured Airbnb dataset containing listing-level attributes such as location, property type, room type, amenities, reviews, availability, and historical pricing information. The data was cleaned, validated, and transformed to ensure consistency and reliability for analysis.

Key steps included:

Handling missing values and inconsistent entries

Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand pricing distributions, correlations, and outliers

Performing feature selection to identify variables with the strongest influence on pricing

Analytical & Machine Learning Approach

I applied data mining and machine learning techniques to model pricing behavior and predict optimal room prices. Multiple classification and regression-based models were developed and compared to evaluate performance and interpretability.

Models and techniques used:

Decision Tree models to identify key pricing drivers and decision rules

Logistic Regression to analyze relationships between pricing levels and booking likelihood

Neural Networks to capture non-linear interactions among listing attributes

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and performance comparison metrics

This multi-model approach enabled both predictive accuracy and business interpretability.

Business Impact & Insights

The analysis identified critical KPIs such as location, room type, amenities, review scores, and availability as key drivers of pricing decisions. By leveraging predictive modeling and data-driven optimization techniques, the project demonstrated an estimated 19% improvement in host profit potential, helping new hosts price their listings more competitively while maintaining profitability.

The insights generated from this project support:

Improved pricing strategies for Airbnb hosts

Better market positioning and revenue optimization

Practical application of machine learning in real-world business decision-making
